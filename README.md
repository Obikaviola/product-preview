## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to style HTML responsively. I also learned how to use the picture tag and also got to find out that font-size affects the picture tag.

```html
  <picture>
    <source media="(min-width: 600px)" srcset="/assets/images/image-product-desktop.jpg">
    <img src="/assets/images/image-product-mobile.jpg" alt="">
  </picture>
```

```css
    picture{
        font-size: 0;
        width: 100%;
    }
```

### Continued development

I will continue to learn how to make responsive website and also learn JavaScript. I'm also looking forward to exploring the html tags that I haven't made use of and to also learn CSS grid.
